#Rules of BlackJack
#The dealer deals 2 cards to the player
#Then gives himself 2 cards; one face up and one facedown
#The player then is given the option to get another card or stay
#if the player hits and busts(goes over 21), the player loses
#if player gets 21 or "BlackJack", they win
#if they stay and still arent at 21
#the dealer reveals his second card
#The dealer must hit when at 16 and must stay on 17
#Aces can be 1 or 11. They will be prompted to pick
#if the dealer goes over 21 or "busts", the player wins

#Functions of Blackjack
